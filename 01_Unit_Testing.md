# What is Unit Testing?

In unit testing, you look to cover the applicationâ€™s functionality at its most basic level. Test each individual unit of code, typically a method, in isolation to see if given certain conditions it responds in the expected way (see Figure 2-1). Breaking testing down to this level gives you confidence that each part of the application will behave as expected and enables you to cover edge cases where the unexpected happens and deal with them accordingly.
