# Writing Your First Unit Test
By now, you are probably eager to start writing your first unit test. Perhaps you have written tests before but are looking for a refresher in how to write good, concise unit tests. Whatever your Python or testing background, let's start at the beginning with some simple tests for a straightforward application. The examples first show you how to structure your test into a class with the correct naming conventions. Further on in the chapter, you are simply shown snippets of test methods, which you are expected to use with a proper test class.

One of the classic examples for demonstrating unit testing is a small calculator program. Python actually includes a lot of basic math functionality in the standard library. But what if you wrapped that into a simple-to-use command line application that could perform some simple calculations? This first scenario demonstrates how to implement the calculate class of the application example from earlier. Start with the add method, which looks something like this.
